# Super Goal Tracker

A tracker that allows you to keep tabs on any goal that you might have.

Users of this tool will be able to define any Activity that they are working on, and build a set of metrics against which they would like to track their progress.  Metrics for each activity can be tightly quantifiable or they can be qualitative, like tracking the number of pages read per day or how you felt while you were reading that day.

Some of the types of metrics that can be included in your Activity definition are:

- Time/duration
- Any unit of measure (e.g., number, weight, etc.) 
- Change over time
- Emotions/reactions -> descriptions
